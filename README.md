**Title: Recreating SpaceX Shopping: A Python-Django Project**

In my final project for QSpider Training Institute, I've undertaken the task of recreating SpaceX's shopping website (https://shop.spacex.com/) using Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

**Project Overview**

This project serves as a clone of SpaceX's online shop, with a focus on the "Men's Shirts" section. While a work in progress, the current version proudly displays the first two t-shirt pages. Additionally, I've implemented an account and cart system, both fully functional and seamlessly connected to a database.

**User Experience and Interaction**

To provide a glimpse into the project's functionality, I've established sample user accounts for you to explore. Feel free to log in using the following credentials:

1st user:
- Email: psurve@gmail.com
- Password: Surve

2nd user:

For a more personalized experience, you're also welcome to create your own user account and discover the intricacies of the shopping interface and cart management.
